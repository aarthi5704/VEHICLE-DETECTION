# VEHICLE-DETECTION
This project is to create a A Vision-Based Traffic Management System. 
The primary goal is to manage real-time traffic at crossroads by detecting vehicles using object detection and image processing as well as predicting the traffic density using Artificial intelligence algorithms. Using cameras installed at a junction we can obtain the number of vehicles using object detection in real-time![image](https://github.com/aarthi5704/VEHICLE-DETECTION/assets/137711075/cc9477f0-e2fc-40a7-b0d9-cecb55da4f56)
